## Game Information
This is a simple Windows Forms game that requires a player to remove bad toys while ensuring that good toys go to the end of the conveyor belt.

If the player allows too many bad toys to leave the conveyor belt, the player loses.
If the player accidentally pulls to many good toys, the player loses.

The conveyor belt will increase in speed as time progresses.

You may spend the points you receive on an in-game bonus that will temporarily slow the conveyor belt.

This game has no end.
